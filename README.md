# Initial Setup

Welcome to your first gitHub Classroom assignment!

This is a really simple one -- the goal here is to make sure we all know how to submit an assignment via gitHub classroom, and have it reviewed.

When I say "we", I do mean we -- this is a good test case for both the students and the instructors!


Before you start this, make sure you have Python, a editor, and git all installed and working.

## gitHub Classroom:

We are using gitHub Classroom to submit and review your work.

Read about gitHub Classroom here:

https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/ProgrammingInPython/topics/01-setting_up/github_classroom.html

That should give you an idea how to proceed on this task.


## Testing Python, and submitting


Once you think you have Python all set to go, you should run the code here:

### To submit it as an assignment

Follow the instructions above for the `install_test.py` file.

Here's the short version:

* if you havne't already, "clone" this repo onto your computer

* Create the `install_test.py` file in the same dir

* Add the file (`git add install_test.py`)

* Commit the file (`git commit -m "adding initial install test"`)

* Push the change(s) to gitHub (`git push`)

* Go to "Feedback" pull request on gitHub, and add a note, tagging your instuctor(s)
